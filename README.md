# Suicidal Tendency Detection using Bi-LSTM-Attention Model
This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting suicidal tweets using a Twitter dataset. The model is trained to classify tweets as either indicative of suicidal ideation or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of tweets collected from Twitter. Each tweet in the dataset is labeled as either indicating suicidal thoughts or not.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model is built using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. It utilizes a neural network architecture, likely employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer-based models like BERT, to analyze the text content of the tweets and make predictions.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before training the model, the dataset needs to be preprocessed. This involves steps such as tokenization, text cleaning, and encoding.
2. **Model Training**: Train the deep learning model using the preprocessed dataset. This step involves feeding the data into the model and adjusting its parameters to minimize classification errors.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps assess how well the model can identify suicidal tweets.
4. **Deployment**: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed to classify tweets in real-time. This could involve integrating the model into a web application, API, or other platforms.
